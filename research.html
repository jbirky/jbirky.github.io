        <p>We present Active Learning for Accelerated Bayesian
        Inference (ALABI): an open-source
        Python package for performing Bayesian inference with computationally expensive models. Given a forward model and
        observational data to construct a likelihood and priors, the algorithm utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model
        trained to predict posterior probability as a function of input parameters, and employs active learning to iteratively
        improve GP predictive performance in high-likelihood regions where the GP is most uncertain. ALABI uses Markov Chain
        Monte Carlo (MCMC), including affine-invariant (emcee) and nested sampling (dynesty) implementations, to sample the GP
        surrogate model. This approach facilitates accurate estimation of the desired posterior distribution, while reducing the
        number of computationally expensive model evaluations required by factors of thousands. We demonstrate the performance
        of ALABI on a variety of test cases and science applications, including where inference is challenging due to strong
        degeneracies or multimodalities.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04082">Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries</a></h3>
        <h4>Marshall Hobson-Ritz, Jessica Birky, Leah Peterson, Peter Gwartney, Rachel Wong, John Delker, Tyler Gordon, Samantha
        Gilbert, James R. A. Davenport, Rory Barnes</h4>

        <p>Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the
        timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, final rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass
        are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing
        binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral
        type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured
        from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing
        Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability,
        non-periodic variability, and "other" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve
        classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot
        modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods:
        Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period
        distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two
        populations: a synchronous population (with Porb ~ Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb ~
        7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a
        unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous
        population is statistically significant.</p>

        <h4>Jessica Birky, Rory Barnes, and David P. Fleming</h4>
        <img src="content/birky21_trappist.jpg" style="width:80%">
        <br />
        <p>We re-examine the XUV luminosity evolution of TRAPPIST-1 utilizing new observational constraints (XUV and bolometric
        luminosity) from multi-epoch X-ray/UV photometry. Following the formalism presented in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab77ad">Fleming et al. (2020)</a>, we infer
        that TRAPPIST-1 maintained a saturated XUV luminosity, relative to the bolometric luminosity, of
        $\log_{10}(L_{\rm xuv}/L_{\rm bol}) = -3.03_{-0.23}^{+0.25}$ at early times for a period of $t_{\rm sat}$ $= 3.14_{-1.46}^{+2.22}$ Gyr.
        After the saturation phase, we find $L_{\rm xuv}$\ decayed over time by an exponential rate of $\beta_{\rm xuv} = -1.17_{-0.28}^{+0.27}$.
        Compared to our inferred age of the system, $\textrm{age} = 7.96_{-1.87}^{+1.78}$ Gyr, our result for $t_{\rm sat}$ suggests that there
        is only a $\sim4\%$~chance that TRAPPIST-1 still remains in the saturated phase today, which is significantly lower than
        the previous estimate of 40\%. Despite this reduction in $t_{\rm sat}$, our results remain consistent in the conclusion that the
        TRAPPIST-1 planets likely received an extreme amount XUV energy---an estimated integrated XUV energy of
        $\sim10^{30}-10^{32}$ erg over the star's lifetime.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab7004">Temperatures and Metallicities of M Dwarfs in the APOGEE Survey</a></h3>
        <h4>Jessica Birky, David W. Hogg, Andrew W. Mann, and Adam Burgasser</h4>
        <img src="content/demo_derivatives_teff1.png" style="width:100%">
        <br />
        M dwarfs have enormous potential for our understanding of structure and formation on both Galactic and exoplanetary scales through their properties and compositions. However, current atmosphere models have limited ability to reproduce
        spectral features in stars at the coolest temperatures (Teff < 4200 K) and to fully exploit the information content of
        current and upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Here we present a catalog of spectroscopic temperatures,
        metallicities, and spectral types for 5875 M dwarfs in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
        (APOGEE) and Gaia-DR2 surveys using The Cannon: a flexible, data-driven spectral-modeling and parameter-inference
        framework demonstrated to estimate stellar-parameter labels (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and detailed abundances) to high precision. Using a
        training sample of 87 M dwarfs with optically derived labels spanning calibrated with bolometric temperatures, and dex
        calibrated with FGK binary metallicities, we train a two-parameter model with predictive accuracy (in
        cross-validation) to 77 K and 0.09 dex respectively. We also train a one-dimensional spectral classification model
        using 51 M dwarfs with Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectral types ranging from M0 to M6, to predictive accuracy
        of 0.7 types. We find Cannon temperatures to be in agreement to within 60 K compared to a subsample of 1702 sources
        with color-derived temperatures, and Cannon metallicities to be in agreement to within 0.08 dex metallicity compared
        to a subsample of 15 FGK+M or M+M binaries. Finally, our comparison between Cannon and APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP DR14)
        labels finds that ASPCAP is systematically biased toward reporting higher temperatures and lower metallicities for M
        dwarfs.
