I'm a third year undergraduate Physics major at UC San Diego, hoping to pursue a PhD in astrophysics. Generally I am interested in the fundamental properties of stars and using large scale stellar surveys to understand the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.

Currently I work at my university with [Adam Burgasser](http://pono.ucsd.edu/~adam/wordpress/) (UCSD) on constructing a forward modeling pipeline for inferring atmospheric parameters of late-M/early-L dwarfs in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment ([APOGEE](http://www.sdss.org/dr13/irspec/)) survey.

I also spent last summer at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de/en) with [David Hogg](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/research.html) (NYU/MPIA/Flatiron) using data-driven approaches to modeling fundamental parameters of M dwarfs in APOGEE, and will be returning next summer to MPIA to work on new projects.
